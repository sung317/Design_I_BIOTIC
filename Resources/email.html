<p>Hello all,</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>To follow up on our meeting today, I wanted to quickly provide a bit of literature to help put the program in context and describe some of the algorithms on the back end.&nbsp; This may or may not be helpful for your upcoming assignments/presentations.</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>- Chang et.al. is a review of Quantitative MRI (qMRI) methods focusing on T1 and T2 mapping, which both gives some basic physics/equations describing the relaxation processes, and provides some examples of where these techniques might be useful clinically.<br>
</p>
<p>- Barral et.al. describes the linearized T1 fitting algorithm that you'll see implemented in the T1 mapping code I will send along shortly.&nbsp; None of this part should have to be modified during this project but I've included it for your reference.</p>
<p>- Pei et.al. describes ARLO, which is a linearized T2 fitting algorithm that I'd like to try and implement eventually - this would replace the core of the current T2 fitting algorithm which uses a much slower non-linear least-squares fit.<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>While it should not be immediately necessary for the project I'd be happy to provide some more basic MRI literature if you are interested - Steven teaches a medical physics course that is ~1/3 MRI and almost certainly has some slides that would be a good
 starting point.<br>
</p>
<p><br>
</p>
<p>I am going to try and package up some code for you all to start looking through based on what I demo'd earlier today, I just need a bit more time to make sure I have all the dependencies taken care of and that you can run everything off-site.&nbsp; I will try
 and have that to you tomorrow.<br>
</p>
